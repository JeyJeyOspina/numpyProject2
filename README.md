# Determining Static Equilibrium in NumPy 

I did this NumPy tutorial about Newton's second law 

Actuality I'm a scientific computing student, this project will present in scientific programming fundamentals subject

I pretend to learn how to represent points, vectors and moments with NumPy, how to find the normal vectors, and using 
Numpy to compute matrix calculations.
